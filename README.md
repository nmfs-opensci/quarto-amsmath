# quarto-amsmath

Project to make progress on getting better support for LaTex users in Quarto books.

* Showing people how to get amsmath to display properly in html
* Give some background on MathJax so people know how to debug
* Figure out how to get the chapters equation number to work (TO DO)
* Maybe work on a Lua filter so that we can use basic LaTeX code throughout (`\section{abc}`) and don't have to re-write our LaTeX code.

# Contributing

Please do! Add issues or put in a pull request. Let's try to stick with proper LaTeX syntax and MathJax syntax, so idea is not to re-create stuff of make up new syntax but to get our existing tools to work in Quarto books.
